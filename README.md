##Getting Started with Git
1. Create an SSH key. Run `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"`
2. [Add the new SSH key to Github](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/#platform-mac)

##Using Git
A small flavour of Git commands: 

Pushing to Github (Without Branches/Pulls): 
- `git add -A` will stage all the files you changed so that you can commit them (next command).
- `git commit -m 'summary of what you changed'` will save the changes.
- `git push origin master` will send your changes to Github.

Updating Your Repository:
-`git pull` will update your local repository to the current version.
-`git stash` will save your changes if you made any after a new version was pushed.
